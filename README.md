ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JetiGithub

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about Data Science, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Mathematical Analysis, Photography, and Travel.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of California, Davis.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡ Fun fact: I chose "Jeti" as my GitHub name (and for most of my social accounts) because it combines the initials of my English name and my last nameâ€”JTâ€”which sounds like "Jeti."
